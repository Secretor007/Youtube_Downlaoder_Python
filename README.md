How It works:

Step 1: Download the zip file and extract it.

Step 2: Go to extracted folder and open that folder in any python IDE.

Step 3: Now open the terminal in IDE and follw the commands:pip install tkinter, pip install pillow, pip install pytube, pip install moviepy, pip install requests, pip install io, pip install thredding, pip install pathlib, pip install pygame

Step 4: Now just run the main.py file and download your favorite videos and songs from youtube.

[**TIP : After clicking "Download Video" button wait for some seconds to load the data and then you can choose the quality you wanted to download.]
